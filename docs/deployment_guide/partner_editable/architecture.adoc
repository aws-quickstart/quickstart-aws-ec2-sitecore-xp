As shown in figures 1 and 2, the Quick Start sets up the following:

The Quick Start sets up the following:

* A highly available architecture that spans two Availability Zones.*
* A virtual private cloud (VPC) configured with public and private subnets, according to AWS best practices, to provide you with your own virtual network on AWS.*
* In the public subnets:
** Managed network address translation (NAT) gateways to allow outbound internet access for resources in the private subnets.*
Microsoft Remote Desktop Gateway (RD Gateway) in an Auto Scaling group. This provides inbound remote desktop access to Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances in the public and private subnets.*
** An external Application Load Balancer (ALB) for routing traffic to the instances for Sitecore content delivery, content management, and identity server roles.
* In the private subnets:
** Sitecore roles deployed on Amazon EC2 instances. Each role is deployed onto one EC2 instance, and each instance is deployed in an Auto Scaling group.
** An internal ALB for the Sitecore reporting and processing roles.
** Network Load Balancers (NLBs) for Transport Layer Security (TLS) pass-through for the remaining Sitecore roles.
** Amazon RDS SQL Server instance.
** Amazon ElastiCache for Redis for cache management.
** Amazon Route 53 private hosted zone for internal Domain Name System (DNS) lookups within the VPC.
* An EC2 Amazon Machine Image (AMI) for the initial deployment of Sitecore roles and subsequent Auto Scaling events.
* AWS Systems Manager to store parameter data and the AMI automation build document.
* Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) artifacts bucket for storing static data.
* Amazon CloudWatch for monitoring deployed services.
* AWS Secrets Manager for access control.
* AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) for access control.
* A Lambda function to convert and import the certificate into ACM.
