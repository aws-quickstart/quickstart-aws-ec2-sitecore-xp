As shown in figures 1 and 2, the Partner Solution sets up the following:

The Partner Solution sets up the following:

* A highly available architecture that spans two Availability Zones.*
* A virtual private cloud (VPC) configured with public and private subnets, according to AWS best practices, to provide you with your own virtual network on AWS.*
* In the public subnets:
** Managed network address translation (NAT) gateways to allow outbound internet access for resources in the private subnets.*
** Microsoft Remote Desktop Gateway (RD Gateway) instances in an Auto Scaling group. This provides inbound remote desktop access to Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances in the public and private subnets.*
* An internal Application Load Balancer to route traffic to Sitecore reporting and processing instances.
* An external Application Load Balancer for routing traffic to Sitecore content and identity role instances.
* Network Load Balancers for Transport Layer Security (TLS) pass-through to the remaining Sitecore instances.
* In the private subnets:
** Sitecore roles deployed on Amazon EC2 instances. Each role is deployed to one EC2 instance, and each instance is deployed to an Auto Scaling group.
** Amazon RDS SQL Server instances.
** Amazon ElastiCache for Redis for cache management.
* An EC2 Amazon Machine Image (AMI) for the initial deployment of Sitecore roles and subsequent Auto Scaling events.
* AWS Systems Manager to store parameter data and the AMI automation build document.
* An Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) bucket for storing static data.
* Amazon CloudWatch for monitoring deployed services.
* AWS Secrets Manager and AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) for access control.
* A Lambda function to convert and import the Sitecore client certificate into ACM.
* An Amazon Route 53 private hosted zone for internal Domain Name System (DNS) lookups within the VPC.
