//Include any pre-deployment steps here, such as signing up for a Marketplace AMI or making any changes to a Partner account. If there are none leave this file empty.

== Predeployment steps
This Partner Solution requires that you https://dev.sitecore.net/[sign up with Sitecore] to obtain the Sitecore XP resource files.

. Obtain a https://www.sitecore.com/knowledge-center/getting-started/developer-trial[temporary Sitecore license] or contact your Sitecore sales representative or
Sitecore partner for a full Sitecore license.
. Upload the license file to an S3 bucket into a prefix called `license`.
. https://dev.sitecore.net/Downloads/Sitecore_Experience_Platform/[Download the Sitecore XP1 scaled installation files.]
. Extract the contents of the .zip file, but donâ€™t extract any of the resulting .zip files. Using the same S3 bucket as the license file, upload these extracted files into a prefix called
`resources`.
. Create a certificate in Amazon Certificate Manager (ACM) for your Sitecore deployment
in the Region where you deploy the Partner Solution. This certificate must be created as a
wildcard certificate for your Sitecore domain (for example, `*.example.com`).

This Partner Solution can optionally deploy a server for Apache Solr search. This Solr
deployment, however, is a development server and not recommended for production use. It
is therefore suggested that you provide a URL to your production Apache Solr search server
or cluster when deploying this Partner Solution.
