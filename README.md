## Sitecore XP on AWS

The Sitecore Experience Platform (XP) is a content management system (CMS) for web content that automates marketing to deliver a personalized user experience. This Quick Start is intended for organizations that want to deploy a multirole Sitecore XP architecture on the AWS Cloud. 

Supported versions <=10.2

It deploys 12 roles that compose the complete Sitecore XP platform. All of the roles are deployed into individual Auto Scaling groups to ensure recoverability when an instance fails. Database services are provided by SQL Server through Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS), and caching is managed by Redis on Amazon ElastiCache.

To control access, this deployment uses AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) and AWS Secrets Manager. Other services used by this Quick Start include Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3), AWS Systems Manager, Amazon CloudWatch, AWS Lambda, and Amazon Route 53.

You can use the AWS CloudFormation templates included with the Quick Start to deploy Sitecore XP in your AWS account in about 1â€“1.5 hours. For more information and step-by-step deployment instructions, see [the guide](https://fwd.aws/yW5pE).

This Quick Start provides two deployment options:

- Deploy Sitecore XP into a new VPC (end-to-end deployment). This option builds a new AWS environment consisting of the VPC, subnets, NAT gateways, security groups, bastion hosts, and other infrastructure components. It then deploys Sitecore XP into this new VPC.
- Deploy Sitecore XP into an existing VPC. This option provisions Sitecore XP in your existing AWS infrastructure.
The Quick Start provides separate templates for these options. It also lets you configure Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) blocks, instance types, and Sitecore XP settings, as discussed later in this guide.

The following diagram shows the architecture for Sitecore XP.
